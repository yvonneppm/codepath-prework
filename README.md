## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- Instagram
  - uploading stories in a close friend list
  - adding songs to posts and stories
  
- Discord
  - adding bots to servers that users can ask to perform functions
  - users can play mini games within the app
  
- Snapchat
  - making custom bitmojis that represent each person
  - sending snaps to catch up with old friends
  
I remember that Instagram used to have a feature where we can make lists and post our stories to each list of people. However, Instagram had removed the feature and I think it would be a great idea to bring it back since it was such an amazing feature. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

When connecting the UI elements to the controller, I deleted one of the existing elements because I made the wrong element. However, I deleted it incorrectly which ended up throwing an error when I tried to run the app. This took quite a while to debug.
